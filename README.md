Hello, In this I created a Product Details Webpage.

First, I created a navbar and a sidebar which consists of two menus: Product Details Page and Compare Products Page. Navbar has Login and Signin section.

In Prdouct Details Page, products API was fetched from DummyJSON. Using this API, I created a table using Ant Design, comprising of details like thumbnail, brand, category, price, ratings, etc. It also has a Compare button to move product details to Compare details page.

In Compare Details page, we can add products to compare using 'Add to Compare' button. We can add multiple products to compare.

The products are compared on the basis of details present in product details section.

Navigation is prepared by React Router DOM.
